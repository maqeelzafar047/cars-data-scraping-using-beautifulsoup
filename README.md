## üìå **Project Overview**

This project showcases the complete pipeline of **scraping, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing car listings data** from [Cars.com](https://www.cars.com) using Python. Built entirely in **Jupyter Lab**, the notebook guides users through extracting meaningful information from multiple pages of real-time car listings, preparing it for analysis, and generating visual insights.

---

## üß† **Key Features**

- ¬†Web scraping with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
- Data transformation and cleanup with `pandas`
- Exploratory data analysis using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Export of structured data to CSV for future use
- Supports scaling to multiple pages (up to 500)



## üß∞ **Technologies Used**

- **Python 3**
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Jupyter Lab** or **Jupyter Notebook**



## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **How to Run This Notebook**

1. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Lab** or **Jupyter Notebook**
2. Ensure the following libraries are installed:
   ```
   pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4 matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. Review and analyze the output and graphs

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How the Code Works**

### 1. **Web Scraping**

Scrapes multiple pages of car listings:

```python
for page in range(1, 500):
    url = f"https://www.cars.com/shopping/results/?page={page}..."
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    # extract desired fields
```

Extracted fields include:

- Car Name
- Mileage
- Dealer Name
- Dealer Rating
- Review Count
- Price
- Location

### 2. **Creating the DataFrame**

```python
car_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Name': names,
    'Mileage': mileage,
    'Dealer': dealers,
    'Rating': ratings,
    'Reviews': reviews,
    'Price': prices,
    'Location': location
})
```

### 3. **Cleaning and Preprocessing**

- Removed dollar signs, commas, and text from numerical fields
- Handled missing/null values gracefully

### 4. **Exporting the Data**

```python
car_data.to_csv("car_data_scraping.csv", index=False)
```

- Cleaned dataset saved locally for further analysis

### **5. Visualizing Insights**

```python
sns.histplot(car_data['Price'], bins=30)
plt.title("Distribution of Car Prices")
```

- Distribution of prices
- Relationship between mileage and price
- Fuel type and brand breakdowns (if extended)

---

## üìä Summary of Findings

- Popular brands and their price distribution
- Mileage trends across listings
- Dealer reputation impact on pricing
- Data suggests how users can filter high-value deals
